# Road-accident-Prediction-Quiz-website
An interactive web app that tests your intuition about road safety.
You’ll be shown two roads — guess which one has a lower predicted accident risk based on their features.

🌟 Features

Randomly generated road scenarios

Simple risk model using weighted factors

Live score tracking (correct / incorrect)

Clean UI built with Tailwind CSS

Works fully offline (no backend)

🧠 How It Works

Each road has random attributes (road type, speed limit, weather, lighting, etc.).
A simplified JavaScript model assigns a risk score based on those features.
Pick the road you think is safer — then see if your guess matches the model!
